# Similar-Text-extraction-from-treatment-guidelines-using-fastText
## Objective:
 1.  Train fastText word embedding on Nigeriaâ€™s 2008 standard treatment guidelines
 2.  See the effect of training fastText embedding models.
 3.  Find semantically similar words generated based on the trained models.
 4.  Use the trained models to pick out words that do not match in a series.
 5.  Calculate the similarity between two words.
 6.  Create Visualization after dimensionality reduction using PCA on some semantically similar words
 
 ## Data:
 What are Standard treatment guidelines?
 The recommended pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical therapies for typical health issues that individuals in a certain healthcare system encounter are listed in standard treatment guidelines (STGs). As a result, they constitute one strategy for encouraging prescription that is both therapeutically beneficial and financially efficient.

The text was downloaded online, the indexes and appendices were removed and extraction from pdf to text was done using Python Tika.

What is fastText?
 FastText is a library developed by Facebook's AI Research (FAIR) team for word embedding and text categorization learning. The model enables the development of supervised or unsupervised word vector representation learning algorithms. For 294 languages, Facebook offers pretrained models. fastText embeds words using a neural network. January 2020, Wikipedia
